## How to use?

Currently, there are six different themes to choose from, each with a unique style to customize the look of your project. The available themes are as follows:

1. Dark Theme: A dark theme that offers a modern and minimalist look, perfect for those who prefer a more sober interface with less visual fatigue.
2. Origin Theme: The origin theme, with a balanced and versatile design, ideal for those who want to maintain a classic and familiar look.
3. Dark Blue: A theme that combines dark tones with shades of blue, offering a sleek and professional look.
4. Blue: This theme is based on different shades of blue, creating a fresh and dynamic atmosphere, perfect for a more lively look.
5. White Style: A light and clean theme, characterized by a bright and airy design, ideal for those who prefer a simple and bright interface.
6. Gray Styles: A theme that uses different shades of gray for a neutral and sophisticated look, suitable for those looking for a discreet and elegant design.

To apply one of these themes, you need to go to your project's style settings. Subsequently, replace the reference code codice.css/js with the number corresponding to the desired theme. For example, enter "1" to apply the
Dark Theme, "2" for the Origin Theme, "3" for Dark Blue, and so on. This simple step will allow you to customize the look of your project quickly and effectively.
